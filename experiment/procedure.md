### Procedure:

● Clean the electrochemical cell and the electrodes with doubled distilled deionized water.
● Take a 15-20 ml of water sample in the electrochemical cell.
● Add 2 ml of HNO<sub>3</sub> for the digestion of organic matter present in the water sample.
● Add ammonium acetate buffer of pH 4.5 as an electrolyte in the solution.
● Before performing the experiment, attach three cords to three electrodes.
● Switch on the potentiostat and the module.
● Open the software NOVA on the computer.
